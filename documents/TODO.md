# Todo list
### Most immediate changes that should happen; **NOT** an extensive list of every feature to be added

- Fix bugs relating to saved data
- Polish and finalize the "Subspace Rift" theme textures.
- Polish Statistics screen
- Consider making game speed increase slower and start slightly faster in all gamemodes.
  - Maybe even make Insane speed slower. Or maybe faster.

## More long term considerations
- Test app on API 35 phone/emulator (tested!)
- Test app on more screen shapes & sizes.
- Consider changing package to remove leading "a"
  - Obviously, consider how that may affect the app on the Google Play Store.
  - Current package is `com.zytronium.a8bitracing`
  - Possible considerations are:
    - `com.zytronium.8bitracing`
    - `com.zytronium.8-bit-racing`
    - `com.zytronium.inf8bitracing`
    - `com.zytronium.inf-8-bit-racing`
    - `com.zytronium.infinite8bitracing`
    - `com.zytronium.infinite-8-bit-racing`
